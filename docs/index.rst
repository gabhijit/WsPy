Welcome to wishpy's documentation!
==================================

'wishpy' implements Python bindings for `Wireshark <https://www.wireshark.org/>`_, a versatile packet analysis tool and `libpcap <https://www.tcpdump.org>`_ a widely used library for network packet capturing.

Main goal of the 'wishpy' project is to bring the wireshark's dissectors to the Python world and make them available to the rich ecosystem of Python's data analysis and visualization tools.
